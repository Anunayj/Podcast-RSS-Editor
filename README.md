# Podcast RSS Editor
After hosting a design podcast, I started manually updating the RSS feed for every episode and quickly got sick of the 'tags dancing', so tried a little bit building this simple Podcast RSS editor in PHP for myself.

# Usage
- Put the XML file you wanna edit in the root and select it in the 'Settings' panel and then you can edit / add episodes.
- There isn't any authentication or security check so please don't put it on the sever in case shit happens.

# Change Log
- [Jul 27, 2017] Added ‘Preview’ function for episode link, image file and audio file.
- [Dec 13, 2016] Added ‘duplicate’ and ‘delete’ functions.
- [Jul 20, 2016] Added multi-language support: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English.
